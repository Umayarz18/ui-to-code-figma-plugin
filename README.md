# Component UI to Code Figma Plugin

Transform a component from figma into a component snippet + live preview:
![Plugin Output showing figma file and the plugin output](/images/output.png 'Plugin Output')

## What it Shows

Given a component design library, select in Figma + output the code needed to
use the same component in code. (Great for design systems with near 1:1
design-to-code alignment)

## Cool Implications

- Designers get easier handoff to developers
- Developers get can get started with code that uses UI components from a component library
- Depending how mock-ups are designed, you could generate whole layouts of code
